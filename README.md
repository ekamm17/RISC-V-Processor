# RISC-V-Processor
A RISC-V processor using Verilog on Xilinx Vivado, focusing on the architecture and functionality of the processor.

We cover a simple implementation of the MIPS (Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipeline Stages) instruction set. This implementation covers the following instructions:
### Load/Store Instructions:
- load word (lw)
- store word (sw)
### Load/Store Instructions:
- jump instruction (j)
- branch equal (beq)
### Arithmetic-logical instructions
- add
- sub
- AND
- OR
- set on less than.
